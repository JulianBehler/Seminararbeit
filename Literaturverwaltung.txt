 abstract = {Mobile payments can be categorized according to their usage in each of the five payment scenarios presented here. The paper proposes the mobile payment modeling approach (MPMA) especially suited for value-based analysis of mobile payment use cases. Based on this approach, the study also develops a set of seven reference models that can classify any given mobile payment use case or mobile payment procedure and analyze it with regard to the business model, the roles of the market participants, and their interrelation from a value-based perspective. An introspective analysis of the mobile payment service provider role and a market constellation analysis which shows the implications of different actors assuming one or more of the respective roles complete the study.},

 abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been transforming the landscape of scientific research. Out of which, the chatbot technology has experienced tremendous advancements in recent years, especially with ChatGPT emerging as a notable AI language model. This comprehensive review delves into the background, applications, key challenges, and future directions of ChatGPT. We begin by exploring its origins, development, and underlying technology, before examining its wide-ranging applications across industries such as customer service, healthcare, and education. We also highlight the critical challenges that ChatGPT faces, including ethical concerns, data biases, and safety issues, while discussing potential mitigation strategies. Finally, we envision the future of ChatGPT by exploring areas of further research and development, focusing on its integration with other technologies, improved human-AI interaction, and addressing the digital divide. This review offers valuable insights for researchers, developers, and stakeholders interested in the ever-evolving landscape of AI-driven conversational agents. This study explores the various ways ChatGPT has been revolutionizing scientific research, spanning from data processing and hypothesis generation to collaboration and public outreach. Furthermore, the paper examines the potential challenges and ethical concerns surrounding the use of ChatGPT in research, while highlighting the importance of striking a balance between AI-assisted innovation and human expertise. The paper presents several ethical issues in existing computing domain and how ChatGPT can invoke challenges to such notion. This work also includes some biases and limitations of ChatGPT. It is worth to note that despite of several controversies and ethical concerns, ChatGPT has attracted remarkable attentions from academia, research, and industries in a very short span of time.},

 abstract = {The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has catalyzed revolutionary changes across various sectors, notably in healthcare. Among the significant developments in this field are the applications of generative AI models, specifically transformers and diffusion models. These models have played a crucial role in analyzing diverse forms of data, including medical imaging (encompassing image reconstruction, image-to-image translation, image generation, and image classification), protein structure prediction, clinical documentation, diagnostic assistance, radiology interpretation, clinical decision support, medical coding, and billing, as well as drug design and molecular representation. Such applications have enhanced clinical diagnosis, data reconstruction, and drug synthesis. This review paper aims to offer a thorough overview of the generative AI applications in healthcare, focusing on transformers and diffusion models. Additionally, we propose potential directions for future research to tackle the existing limitations and meet the evolving demands of the healthcare sector. Intended to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners interested in the healthcare applications of generative AI, this review provides valuable insights into the current state of the art, challenges faced, and prospective future directions.},

Leveraging deep generative models, generative AI is capable of producing novel and realistic content across a broad spectrum (e.g., texts, images, or programming code) for various domains based on basic user prompts. In this article, we offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of generative AI with its underpinning concepts and prospects. We provide a conceptual introduction to relevant terms and techniques, outline the inherent properties that constitute generative AI, and elaborate on the potentials and challenges. We underline the necessity for researchers and practitioners to comprehend the distinctive characteristics of generative artificial intelligence in order to harness its potential while mitigating its risks and to contribute to a principal understanding.},

 abstract = {Reprint: R0403E Microsoft's and Wal-Mart's preeminence in modern business has been attributed to any number of factors---from the vision and drive of their founders to the companies' aggressive competitive practices. But the authors maintain that the success realized by these two very different companies is due only partly to the organizations themselves; a bigger factor is the success of the networks of companies with which Microsoft and Wal-Mart do business. Most companies today inhabit ecosystems---loose networks of suppliers, distributors, and outsourcers; makers of related products or services; providers of relevant technology; and other organizations that affect, and are affected by, the creation and delivery of a company's own offering. Despite being increasingly central to modern business, ecosystems are still poorly understood and even more poorly managed. The analogy between business networks and biological ecosystems can aid this understanding by vividly highlighting certain pivotal concepts. The moves that a company makes will, to varying degrees, affect the health of its business network, which in turn will ultimately affect the organization's performance---for ill as well as for good. Because a company, like an individual species in a biological ecosystem, ultimately shares its fate with the network as a whole, smart firms pursue strategies that will benefit everyone. So how can you promote the health and the stability of your own ecosystem, determine your place in it, and develop a strategy to match your role, thereby helping to ensure your company's well-being? It depends on your role---current and potential---within the network. Is your company a niche player, a keystone, or a dominator? The answer to this question may be different for different parts of your business. It may also change as your ecosystem changes. Knowing what to do requires understanding the ecosystem and your organization's role in it.},
